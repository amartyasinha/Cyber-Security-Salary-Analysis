## Chapter 1
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Cyber Security is one of the most critical domains in the IT sector. But, many people do not move into this domain due to the lack of knowledge about it. It also includes the pay scale in this domain in their location.

The recent data breach that targeted giants like Uber and Rockstar games (causing colossal losses) has proved the need for more Cyber Security experts.

This Data Analysis on Cyber Security Salaries is meant to provide complete information regarding the pay scale in this domain, including the salary comparison of different posts in different countries and much more.

The Word Cloud will enable one to know the most used word in the domain of Cyber Security, and various graph plots will help to visualize the salaries concerning various factors easily.

The Analysis will use various python libraries and modules, including NumPy, pandas (for data analysis), matplotlib (for data visualization), and others.

The following fields (columns) will be part of this analysis:
| Columns | datatype |
| --- | --- |
| work_year | int |
| experience_level | string |
| employment_type | string |
| job_title | string |

### STEPS TO BE USED FOR ANALYSIS
The following steps will be followed during the analysis of Cyber Security Salaries. The steps may change with further work and analysis performed (by us).
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: This step will not take too much time as the dataset does not has uneven values, and every column will be used for further analysis.
2. Comparative Analysis on different factors: Comparative Analysis will let us know the salary difference in different countries and companies.
It will help in knowing which countries and companies spend more on cyber security. Other factors, including remote ratio, and employment type, will also be compared.
3. Data Visualization: This step will include plotting various graphs, including but not limited to bar graphs, pie charts, boxplots, distplots, and other plots to visualize the actual data.
It will enable everyone to understand the dataset easily.
